 * Description: This program is working as a pipeline in linux.
 * An pipeline is when you do several commands but the first command
 * send's the out data to the next command and that command takes the data and use it 
 * with it's own command, and so on.
 * An exempel of pipeline in linus is "cat -n mexec.c | grep -B4 -A2 return | less".
 * This program will take a text-file as a parameter with each command on a new line.
 * You can also run the program like "./mexec < file" instead of a file input. 
 * This will take the commands from text-file and store it in stdin buffer.
 * You can also run the program with "./mexec" and type in the command by your self.
 * After entering the commands you press ctrl-d to tell the program to run.
 * 
 * Exampel of a text-file or in data by user:
 * cat -n mexec.c
 * grep -B4 -A2 return
 * less
